## Homework
* Summary for some terminologies: GPS
* 2 Questions that could be a test question

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a U.S.-owned utility that provides users with positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. This system consists of three segments: the space segment, the control segment, and the user segment. The U.S. Air Force develops, maintains, and operates the space and control segments.

The GPS space segment consists of a constellation of satellites transmitting radio signals to users.
The United States is committed to maintaining the availability of at least 24 operational GPS satellites, 95% of the time.
To ensure this commitment, the Air Force has been flying 31 operational GPS satellites for the past few years.
