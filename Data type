# Lesson 3

## Data type
int 4 bytes
Char 1 bytes
long 8 bytes
float 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
boolean 1 byte

Objects data type automatically change the storage space to fit the size of the data


## OOP
* association: a hard line
* dependence: dotted line with a simpole arrow
* inheritance/generalization : solid line with hollow arrow
* implementation/realization : dotted line with hollow arrow

- minimize dependencies
* more dependency -> more complexity
* more complexity -> more posible problems & more difficulty to maintain

### Reduce dependency
* Encapsulation (Information hiding)
* Modularity : Dividing each level of disign into sepratable parts 
  * A kind of abstraction
